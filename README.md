# KidNamedTony's Code Problems Repository

In an attempt to tackle common code problems (especially those that are often asked in technical interviews) and get as much practice as possible, I'm uploading .py files with answers that I've both found and/or muddled through. It's public evidence that I did them, and often, very embarrassing public evidence that I've still got a lot left to learn!

With luck and perseverance, there'll be noticeable improvement over time as I get more and more practice on future code problems.
